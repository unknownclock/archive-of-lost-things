              <i>Archive of Lost Things</i> is a digital collection of items
              that are no longer in your possession — and thereby, no longer
              part of the physical world — but remain alive in your memory,
              emotions, and imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some things vanish by accident. Others are given away, forgotten,
              or destroyed with intent. Yet they linger — not in drawers or
              boxes, but in the stories we tell about them. Their absence,
              whether impossibly large or frighteningly insignificant, is felt.
            </p>
            <p>
              This archive is a space for those stories. A place to reflect, to
              remember, and to record what was lost — and what still remains.

                  with ██████████. Blows were exchanged, limbs were lost and
                  grown back. After ██████ had gotten the upper-hand, slipping
                  into their shadow and using ██████████'s shadow to pop up
                  behind them, they slit their throat, red, hot blood spilling
                  everywhere. But the battle wasn't over as ██████████ blew up,
                  and ██████ was caught in the crossfire, their black blood
                  spilling everywhere and getting on the knife that was already
                  on it's last legs of life. "

                  go through my jewelry from my Nana and just like take it out

                  honestly don’t understand how it got lost if it was like a

                  didn’t realize until sophomore year, but like of college but
                  all I was pretty like upset about it, but I still kept the
                  other earring cause I was like maybe it’ll turn up like maybe
                  I’m just like missing it and it’s like somewhere here But
                  every time I like go back into my jewelry bag and I like pull
                  out my stuff I realize again that like oh yeah, I missing that
                  earring and I’m like kind of like sad about it because I feel
                  attached to the items that my Nana gave me because it’s like
                  its still like the last things I have of her so I guess I’m
                  like a little disappointed in myself every time I see that
                  there’s only one, so I’m like how did I not keep track of this
                  but also, I still keep the single earring, even if I can’t
                  necessarily wear it because of the sentimental value"

                <strong>Curator's Note:</strong><br />
                Item is very important to the owner because of the familial
                connection to it. As it's a memento, it has a lot of emotional
                weight/personal value. Even though they have other mementos,
                losing anything of someone who you loved and is no longer here
                can be tough.

                <strong>Emotional Residue:</strong>
                Does this object still appear in your imagination, dreams, or
                daily thoughts? * Honestly kind of as I said before I don’t
                really think about it unless I go into my jewelry bag I have
                like pretty bad object permanence and so I don’t really think
                about things and less I can see them and it’s part of why I’m
                not very good at keeping track of things and why I put it in a
                specific bag But every time I do go into the bag I do you think
                about it a little bit for that day but it’s not some thing I
                perseverate on because I feel like it’s been so long and I can
                only really beat myself up about it for so long and it really
                wasn’t intentional so
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Aura:</strong> I think the object would have like a
                warm, kind of comforting or like it’s I guess it’s something
                that if you see it you’re like kind of a piece or like it gives
                you like good memories so it’s like happiness

                  <strong>Method of Attainment</strong> When Melantha was hired
                  to work at Quantum Logic Forensics four years ago (2137), she
                  leaped into the air, arms swinging, grin bursting upon her
                  face, and cheery laughter escaping her mouth. Although she was
                  initially dissapointed to be have been accepted to Division 4
                  (as it's known as being filled with weirdos), she reassured
                  herself that she'd prove her worth and be moved up to Division
                  4. Despite her discomfort with androids, she had mentally
                  prepared herself to work alongside the FECA (Forensic Evidence
                  Collector and Analyzer) androids. After getting her badge, she
                  quickly customized it, changing the colors to a pinkish-purple
                  cloudy/cosmic aesthetic, which she often did with her assorted
                  objects and knickknacks no matter how much her brother called
                  her boring and childish for doing so.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Meaning:</strong> To Melantha, it represented her
                  first steps out into the real world and to overcoming the
                  odds. These days humans who aren't apart of the upper echelon
                  of society struggle to find jobs while having to compete with
                  robots that took their jobs and androids who replaced them in
                  the few they could still have. While she had spent a very
                  brief part of her childhood imagining her being a
                  world-renowned artist, or critically-accalimed novelist, she
                  had quickly been reminded of her place in society while
                  watching her parents desperately cling to the jobs they had.
                  After they had been fired, and they struggled to make ends
                  meet with government assistance, she'd promised herself she'd
                  find a good job and save her family from their despondency and
                  struggle. And now, that her badge had come in the mail along
                  with a letter welcoming her to Quantum Logic Forensics, she
                  could taste the nice apartment, the spices and herbs from the
                  higher-quality food, and the end of her struggle on the tip of
                  her tongue.​ hshe
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Last Memory of it:</strong>She had just left Quantum
                  Logic Forensics after finishing up the all the paperwork she
                  had to write and double-check for the FECA, scanning her badge
                  to go through security to leave. Her feet ached and her head
                  buzzing with a headache and yet feeling foggy. She dragged
                  herself to the bus stop to take the bus she took every
                  morning, sheets of raining clinging to her skin, and making
                  her blink furiously to see right. As she crossed the street,
                  smart cars drove right past her, and just as she was about to
                  reach the other side of the street, her memory cuts out.
                </li>
                <li><strong> Method of Loss:</strong></li>
                She doesn't remember, her memory bank having been heavily
                damaged
                <strike>tampered with?</strike>
                during the accident she can't even fully remember. Without it,
                she can't go back to work, can't prove her identity, nothing.
                She searches for it desperately, as it could help her figure out
                what happened that night. She knows she wasn't hit by any cars,
                as their AI was too advanced and her wounds didn't match up.
                <li>
                  <strong>Moment of Loss:</strong>She thinks she must have lost
                  it during the accident, having been so injured that her memory
                  bank/brain was damaged, her bones grounded to dust, her body
                  punctured and bleeding out in numerous places, and organs
                  bruised or heavily damaged.

                <li>
                  <strong>Method of Attainment</strong> Tetsuya Watanabe had
                  been only 12 years old when he tried snatched this zippo from
                  the local convience store 5 blocks from his house. Back then
                  he'd take or fight to get whatever he wanted, whenever he
                  wanted. So like all the other times, he'd thought he'd be
                  successful. If he could blame anything or anyone for why he
                  failed for the first time in his life, it'd be on the noisy,
                  self-righteous high school girl who caught wind of him
                  slipping it into his back pocket and snatched his arm,
                  dragging him to the front of the store before he could slip
                  out unnoticed. He'd barely managed to claw her hand off him,
                  making a mad dash for the door, lighter slipping from his
                  hands and his so-called friends who dared him scurring off
                  like the filthy rats they were. He swore he'd be back for that
                  lighter in his head as dashed off to his house, and he did,
                  successfully pulling off the capor a couple days later. He'd
                  roped his slimy weasely friends into the plan, the same slimy
                  weasely friends that always encouraged his less-than-legal
                  activities for entertainment. Going much later in the night,
                  and having his friends distract the owner who'd surely
                  recognize him, he slipped into the store right behind them,
                  crouching behind shelves, and rolling around like a spy until
                  he caught sight of that same old zippo, snatching it up and
                  sneaking out again. Back then, it'd just been a dark blue
                  lighter. Despite all the effort he put into procuring it, he'd
                  handed it off to his 9 year old brother, making sure to tape
                  it closed before tossing it to him. He'd been surprised to see
                  that same lighter 3 years later, tape removed and the words
                  'Zombie Boy' and a scull scratched into the side as a gift
                  from his now 12 year old brother. Tetsuya had been in the
                  hospital for a couple days after a stabbing, his rambunctious
                  trouble-making snowballing to full-blown gang activity. At the
                  time, Tetsuya had thought it was cool, laughing and slapping
                  his brother's back with thanks. Now 27 years old and a leader
                  of a gang, he found it more cringey than anything else.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Meaning:</strong> It was something he had stolen,
                  gifted to his brother, and his brother gifted back to him.
                  After his brother died due to being associated to him by one
                  of the many victim's created by Tetsuya's gang activity, it's
                  his only memento of him. He carries it everywhere, running his
                  hand over the jagged lettering and wobbly skull scratched into
                  it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Last Memory of it:</strong> He had been messing with
                  it again, flicking it open and closed, the light still bright
                  as always. He always fidgeted with it, even though he stopped
                  smoking a month after his brother died. He was fidgeting with
                  it now, sitting in a car, driving to another fight when a car
                  T-Boned his car.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Method of Loss:</strong> Disappeared during Car
                  Accident
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Moment of Loss:</strong> During the accident, his
                  driver was desperate to gain control of the car but failed.
                  When he woke up after being in a coma for two weeks, it was
                  gone. After sending people to check the crash site and asking
                  around, he still couldn't find it. So he resigned himself to
                  having lost both his brother and his memory.

                  combining parts of a spider, a wolf, and bird, and a dragon.

                  cosplay, fit with a corset, layered petticoats, a top hat, a
                  high-neck blouse with ruffles, heeled boots, and finally the
                  glasses. She had dutifully worn it throughout the event,

                  <strong>Moment of Loss:</strong> Being so overcrowded, she
                  couldn't help getting bumped left and right until someone's
                  loose arm smacked into her face, knocking the glasses off her
                  face, cracking the fragile lens. As she attempted to reach for
                  it, someone had callously stepped on it, smirking before
                  disappearing into the crowd of travelers. Picking up her
                  shattered frames, she hoped she could buy another, but the
                  little boutique she had bought it from had gone bankrupt and
                  had closed a couple months after she bought it.

              <strong>Object Description:</strong> Well it's a range of objects
              technically. I basically had around 6 different Nintendo ds games,
              half or more than half were lost. So they'd look like regular old
              Nintendo games in terms of size, weight, smell. I never smelled it
              so I wouldn't know that. Most Nintendo ds games are grey with each
              little image telling what game it is being different. I don't
              remember every game I had, but I remember at least 3, that being
              the Survivor game, Hannah Montana Ds game, and the Junior Classic
              Books and Fairytales game. I also had one Pokémon game but I don't
              remember which one it was. I didn't scratch them up or anything,
              and I even had a little case for my Nintendo ds that had slots for
              the games, so I'd always keep either in there when I wasn't
              playing it, or in the case the games came in.

                  <strong>Method of Attainment</strong> So I'll preface this
                  story with the story of how I got my Coral Pink Nintendo DS in
                  the first place. So my dad runs a PC repair shop and has for
                  as long as I can remember. Sometimes, instead of payment, or
                  as thanks, he'd get random items and things that he could sell
                  to recoup the price of his services. One such time, he got a
                  coral pink Nintendo ds. I was pretty young at the time,
                  definitely elementary school I'd say, and one night, he just
                  came home with it and gave it to me. At the time, me and my
                  brother played games a lot. We both had Gameboys with games,
                  and would often play random twoplayer pc games. At the time,
                  it came with the Pokémon DS game, (I still can't remember each
                  one, I want to say it was Pokémon red but not sure about
                  that). I immediately started playing with and had fun with it.
                  For the rest of the games I got, I think I got them through
                  Christmas and Birthday presents ( I still have the cases for
                  the games in my room at home somewhere).
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Meaning:</strong> It's not like it played a huge role
                  in my life. But still, I played with it a lot as a kid,
                  playing and replaying games on it and reading stories on it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Last Memory of it:</strong> My last memory of it was
                  me bringing it to Nigeria to visit family I think the summer
                  of 2013, and losing half/more than half of them because of my
                  brother.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong> Method of Loss:</strong> My brother, mother, and I
                  had traveled to Nigeria to visit family the summer of 2013.
                  The days were hot and long, and there was no stable internet
                  (without paying a ton of money) and the power would cut out
                  randomly where we were because both my mom and dad came from
                  small villages. I think either me and my brother got into an
                  argument, or he was just annoying me because he decided to
                  take some of my games and hold them away from me when we were
                  both sitting on a couch in the living room. I kept trying to
                  reach for it, and he kept moving it away from me, and
                  eventually, he lost his grip on it, and it fell through a
                  crack in the couch, the kind that is so small it's impossible
                  to get anything back from it.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Moment of Loss:</strong> Well the second it had
                  slipped into the couch, I knew I wasn't getting it back. I was
                  very annoyed by my brother because not only had some of one of
                  the few sources of entertainment we had there been lost
                  because of him, but also because at the time, semi-attached to
                  it and played with it very often, and I liked those games he
                  lost.
                </li>

                <strong> Emotional Residue: </strong> Despite how attached I was
                back then, it doesn't pop into my head very often. Typically
                only when I'm reminded of it through images, videos, or finding
                some of the stuff I had for my Nintendo DS or the games' cases.
