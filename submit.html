              <i>Archive of Lost Things</i> is a digital collection of items
              that are no longer in your possession — and thereby, no longer
              part of the physical world — but remain alive in your memory,
              emotions, and imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some things vanish by accident. Others are given away, forgotten,
              or destroyed with intent. Yet they linger — not in drawers or
              boxes, but in the stories we tell about them. Their absence,
              whether impossibly large or frighteningly insignificant, is felt.
            </p>
            <p>
              This archive is a space for those stories. A place to reflect, to
              remember, and to record what was lost — and what still remains.

      <p>
        The Archive of Lost Things is a digital collection of items that are no
        longer in your possession — and thereby, no longer part of the physical
        world — but remain alive in your memory, emotions, and imagination.

        Some things vanish by accident. Others are given away, forgotten, or
        destroyed with intent. Yet they linger — not in drawers or boxes, but in

        or frighteningly insignificant, is felt.

      <h2>What Is a Lost Thing?</h2>
      <p>
        A lost thing is any object that is no longer in your possession —
        intentionally or unintentionally — and whose location is unknown. You
        can’t find it. You likely never will. And yet… it still exists for you.
      </p>
      <p>That presence in absence is what matters here.</p>

      <p>Your lost thing might live on as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A vivid memory</li>
        <li>A blurry photo</li>
        <li>A sketch or drawing</li>
        <li>A version or replica</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What matters most is the feeling of the thing — and the story it
        carries.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Submit</h2>
      <p>Fill out the submission form.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe your object — in writing and/or a voice recording.</li>
        <li>If you have a visual (photo, drawing, or version), upload it.</li>
        <li>If your object exists only in memory, describe it in detail.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Voice recordings are encouraged — your voice brings it to life.</p>

      <h2>What to Include</h2>
      <p>Please describe:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What the object looked like</li>
        <li>What it meant to you</li>
        <li>The story of how you got it</li>
        <li>The story of how you lost it</li>
        <li>What memories or emotions are tied to it</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote>
        “Objects are never just objects. They are doors that open to free our
        emotions. They are material things that contain memories — even a tiny
        part — of who we are and what we’ve lived.”
